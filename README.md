# Classic_HelloWorld
Simple exercise to create a repo,  add to it, etc...

Well, I've had experience editing UNIX O/S kernel internals
in addition to randome userland classic commands.  I'm
not the fastest programmer, but given time, I can grasp most
things.  The one exception is the bottom half of the kernel.
I'm still at times mystified by where and when to set interrupt
priority levels, and when it's safe to rlease them.  I'm just
being honest.  I'm in awe of many of the programmers I've
been privileged to work with.I've watched superfastprogrammers
use adb(1) (no, not the android bridge crap) to disassemble
the machine code representing the Robbert Morris worm,
with one person driving the keyboard, Don Seely looking over his shoulder
helping him to convery the machinecode->assemply code back into
to high level C code it most likely came from.  I watched as Don
and the other programmer sat in stark confusion as they 
eventually uncovered a *bug* in our compiler!  To Robert
Morris's defense, he never intended his worm to bring
our lacal area net to a grinding halt.  It was that compiler
bug that caused what should have been a few seconds of
sleep into passing the seep routine an unintentional zero!
In other words, what should have been a mild forking of
the worm into, what's called in some circles, a "rabbit".
That is, an unbound replicating of processes that causes the
worm to turn into an unintentional DOS (denial of service)
attack; an attack the author of the worm never intended.
The irony is that if not for the compiler bug, we may never
have discovered the presence of the worm for a much longer time!

Yes, what he did was wrong -- but I still think it was unfair to
decide to "make an example" of him and apply unfair punitive
damages.  Secondly, and a real pet peeve of mine, I will
never forgive the mass media for taking OUR word "hacker", which
was a positive description of a programmer willing to stay up all
night, two if necessary, to get the job done-- and, with no right,
turn it into a word meaning a computer criminal.  They're douche
bags for doing so, and if you use that word their way, well, you're
a douchbag with your head up your ass too.  That's NOT what the word
meant or means.

Anyway, that's my two cents.Take it or  shove it where the sun
don't shine.  Have a yippy dippy day, oh, and don't forget
to watch "Rick and Morty".  The greatest show to grace us in
a long long time...  I download *old* shows off pirate bay all
the time, and I dl'd Rick n Morty just to have good copies of them.  But
then I logged in to Google Play Movies and Tv shows and *bought* both
seasons.  Please support shows that deserve it!
